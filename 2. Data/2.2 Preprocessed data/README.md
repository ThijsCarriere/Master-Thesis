# Preprocessed data

In this folder, the data files after preprocessing can be found. They can be obtained with the scripts in folder 3.2.

The folder contains the following documents:
- mimic_cont_detect.csv: this file contains the TIMSS data needed to detect DIF with the MIMIC model when countries are aggregated to continents. These data are not used in the theses itself.
- mimic_cont_explain.csv: this file contains the TIMSS data with centered response times on continent level. Like the first file, these data are not used in the thesis.
- mimic_df_raw_times: in this file, the TIMSS data (on country level) with response times can be found. It is used to obtain the summary statistics presented in the thesis.
- mimic_df_standtimes.csv: this file contains the same data as the file above, but now the response times are person-mean centered. This file is used in the detection en explanation analyses of the empirical example of the thesis.
