#**Data**

In this folder, all data used in the project can be found.


**2.1** 
In this folder, the raw TIMSS data used for the empirical example can be found. The data is obtained from https://timss2019.org/international-database/.
The TIMSS documentation is stored as well in this folder. Some of the choices in this project are made based on the information found in this document.
In order to process the raw data to the format used for the analyses in the project, the script 'timss_preprocessing.rmd' in the folder 'scripts' should be used.

**2.2** 
In this folder, the preprocessed data files can be found. These files are used in several scripts to obtain the results of the empirical examples. 
In order to reproduce the empirical results in this thesis, these files must be used with scripts from the folder scripts.
In the scripts folder, it is mentioned what data files are needed exactly for what results.

**2.3** 
In this folder, the outcomes of the simulation part of the study can be found. These results are then summarised and analysed with **...** to obtain the results for Table 3 and Table 4 of the Thesis.
