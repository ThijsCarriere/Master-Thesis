# Master Thesis Thijs Carrière

In this repository you can find all documents and code related to my Master Thesis project for the [Research Master MSBBSS](https://www.uu.nl/masters/en/methodology-and-statistics-behavioural-biomedical-and-social-sciences) at Utrecht University. 
The project, called 'Using Process Data in the Explanation and Detection of Differential Item Functioning', tries to use process data (for example, response times) to explain differential item functioning. The goals are to find a use for process data in DIF detection/explanation and to see if process data can be used to distinguish between meaningful DIF and bias.

## Repository organisation
The repository contains the following folders:

**1. Texts:**<br>
In this folder, the documents that form the products of this project are presented. This includes the research report and the master thesis.
<br><br>
**2. Data:**<br>
In this folder, all data used in this project can be found. The three subfolders give:
- the public raw TIMSS data, used for the empirical example (2.1)
- the TIMSS data after preprocessing, used for the analyses of the thesis (2.2)
- the data obtained by the simulations, used for the simulation outcomes in the thesis (2.3)<br>

**3. Scripts:**<br>
In this folder, all scripts can be found that are used in the analyses and pre-processing of the project. With the use of these scripts, all results can be obtained and recreated.
