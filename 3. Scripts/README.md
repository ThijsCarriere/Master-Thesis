# Scripts

In the folders, all scripts can be found that are needed to obtain the results presented in the thesis.

### 3.1 TIMSS Preprocessing

The script in this folder is used to process the raw TIMSS data to the format that can be used in the main analyses of the thesis (DIF detection and DIF explanation). 

### 3.2 TIMSS analyses

In this folder, the scripts for the DIF detection and DIF explanation of the TIMSS data can be found. The `html` files are the results of these scripts (dif_detection_timss.Rmd and dif_explanation_timss.Rmd), and the numbers of these documents are used in as the findings in the thesis (Table 5 and Table 6). 
The descriptive analyses are run in the script ''. The results of these analyses are used in the thesis for Table 3, Table 4, Figure 3, and Figure 4.
All input files for these scripts can be found in folder 2.2.

### 3.3 Simulations

In this folder, the scripts for the simulation parts of the thesis can be found. The script 'Simulation_script.Rmd' contains the written function, run for the simulations. It also containts the simulations itself. The output of the script is 'Simulation_outcomes', which can be found in folder 2.3. 
In the script 'Simulation_Findings.Rmd', the Simulation_outcomes are analysed to the results presented in Table 1 and Table 2 of the thesis. 

*Please note that the numbering of the conditions in the scripts is not the same numbering as presented in the tables in the thesis document.*
